# lk-phaser-demo

Demo application for project Lost Kingdom - Phaser. This application demonstrates three different approaches to implementing tilemaps in Phaser. The application includes four scenes:

## Scenes

### 1. MainMapScene
Usage of SpriteGPULayer object for creating multiple layer in grid like map

## Non-Functional Requirements

The mandatory non-functional requirements for our game are:

A) The map size must be **1024x1024 tiles**.

B) Zooming must be implemented, including a maximum zoom-out level.

C) The application must run on mobile devices (Android/iOS).

This project is a demonstration of potential solutions for implementing large tilemaps in Phaser while considering performance and usability constraints. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
